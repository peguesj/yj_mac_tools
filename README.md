# Symbolic Link Management Script
Author: Jeremiah Pegues  
License: GNU General Public License v3.0  
Version: 1.0.0  

## Description:

This bash script creates symbolic links for all files found within a macOS Smart Folder (savedSearch) to another directory. If a link exists already and is pointing to the same file, no new link is created. If a link exists but points to a different file, a new link is created with an incremented suffix before the file extension.

The script includes options to check symbolic links for validity. If a symbolic link is broken, it can either print a message or automatically remove the broken link based on the command-line argument passed.

Additionally, an update function removes all links in a target directory and replaces them with new links representing the contents of the .savedsearch file at runtime.

## Usage:

Make the script executable:

```zsh|{type:'command'}
chmod +x smartFolderToSymbolikLink.sh
```

Run the script with the desired option:

* `-u <link_path>` - Update links. Replace `<link_path>` with the path to the folder where you want the links to be created.
* `-r <link_path>` - Validate and remove broken links. Replace `<link_path>` with the path to the folder with the links.
* `-v <link_path>` - Validate and print broken links without removing them.

Example:

```zsh|{type:'command'}
./smartFolderToSymbolikLink.sh -u /path/to/link_folder
```

This will create symbolic links for all files in the savedSearch folder into the specified link_folder. If any links already exist, they will be updated according to the rules described above.

## Disclaimer:

Please ensure you back up your data before running this or any other script that modifies the file system. Although this script has been designed with safety in mind, there's always the potential for unintended side effects when modifying files and directories, particularly when those operations are automated.
